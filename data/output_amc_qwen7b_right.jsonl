Now we have a system of linear equations:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   \\mu + n = 10 \\\\\n   2n + 3\\mu = 27\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From Equation 1, we get \\( n = 10 - \\mu \\). Substituting this into Equation 2 gives:\n   \\[\n   2(10 - \\mu) + 3\\mu = 27 \\implies 20 - 2\\mu + 3\\mu = 27 \\implies \\mu = 7\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( \\mu = 7 \\) back into Equation 1 gives:\n   \\[\n   7 + n = 10 \\implies n = 3\n   \\]\n\nSo the current mean of Maureen's quiz scores is \\( \\mu = 7 \\). Let's verify this solution using Python code to ensure its accuracy.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nmu, n = symbols('mu n')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\neq1 = Eq(mu + n, 10)\neq2 = Eq(2*n + 3*mu, 27)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (mu, n))\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n{mu: 7, n: 3}\n```\nThe solution to the system of equations is \\( \\mu = 7 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\).

Let's assume that each glass has a capacity of 1 unit of juice.\n2. Mrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely, so each of these glasses has 1 unit of juice.\n3. The fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, so it has $\\frac{1}{3}$ units of juice.\n4. The total amount of juice is $1 + 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = 3 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}$ units.\n5. To distribute this juice equally among the four glasses, each glass should have $\\frac{10}{3} \\div 4 = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$ units of juice.\n6.

What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle?", "answer": 4.0, "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2023_AMC_12B_Problems/Problem_5", "ori_output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of guesses required to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by a hidden $2 \\times 1$ rectangle on a $3 \\times 3$ grid. The hidden rectangle can be oriented either horizontally or vertically, and it covers two adjacent squares.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and the Rectangle:**\n   - The grid is a $3 \\times 3$ grid, which means it has 9 squares.\n   - The hidden rectangle covers two adjacent squares, either horizontally or vertically.\n\n2. **Possible Configurations:**\n   - There are 6 possible horizontal configurations (3 rows, each with 2 possible starting positions).\n   - There are 4 possible vertical configurations (3 columns, each with 2 possible starting positions).\n   - In total, there are $6 + 4 = 10$ possible configurations for the hidden rectangle.\n\n3. **Strategy to Find the Minimum Number of Guesses:**\n   - We need to find a strategy that guarantees we will find at least one square covered by the hidden rectangle in the minimum number of guesses.\n   - We can use a systematic approach to eliminate possibilities with each guess.\n\n4. **Systematic Approach:**\n   - Let's label the squares of the grid as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n     \\hline\n     1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - We can start by guessing square 5, which is in the center of the grid. This guess will help us eliminate the most possibilities.\n   - If square 5 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 1 guess.\n   - If square 5 is not covered, we can then guess squares 1, 3, 7, or 9. Let's say we guess square 1. If square 1 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 2 guesses. If square 1 is not covered, we can then guess square 3. If square 3 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 3 guesses. If square 3 is not covered, we can then guess square 7. If square 7 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 4 guesses. If square 7 is not covered, we can then guess square 9. If square 9 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 5 guesses. If square 9 is not covered, we can then guess square 2, 4, 6, or 8. Let's say we guess square 2. If square 2 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 6 guesses. If square 2 is not covered, we can then guess square 4. If square 4 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 7 guesses. If square 4 is not covered, we can then guess square 6. If square 6 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 8 guesses. If square 6 is not covered, we can then guess square 8. If square 8 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 9 guesses. If square 8 is not covered, we can then guess square 6. If square 6 is covered, we have found a square covered by the rectangle in 10 guesses. If square 6 is not covered, we can then guess square 8.

This is because the code simulates the guessing process and verifies that with a systematic approach, we can find a covered square in 4 guesses.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).", "probs": []}

For example, $B = {4, 6, 8, 11}$ satisfies the condition.", "answer": 144.0, "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2023_AMC_12B_Problems/Problem_8", "ori_output": "To solve this problem, we need to find all nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 12\\}\\) such that the number of elements in \\( B \\) is equal to the least element of \\( B \\).\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the possible sizes of the subsets \\( B \\):**\n   - The least element of \\( B \\) can be any integer from 1 to 12 (since the subset must be nonempty and the least element must be in the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\)).\n   - If the least element of \\( B \\) is \\( k \\), then \\( B \\) must have exactly \\( k \\) elements.\n\n2. **Construct the subsets \\( B \\):**\n   - For each possible least element \\( k \\) (from 1 to 12), we need to choose \\( k-1 \\) elements from the set \\(\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\) to form the subset \\( B \\).\n\n3. **Count the number of valid subsets for each \\( k \\):**\n   - If the least element is \\( k \\), then we need to choose \\( k-1 \\) elements from the set \\(\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 12\\}\\), which has \\( 12-k \\) elements. The number of ways to choose \\( k-1 \\) elements from \\( 12-k \\) elements is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{12-k}{k-1}\\).\n\n4. **Sum the number of valid subsets for all possible \\( k \\):**\n   - We need to sum the binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{12-k}{k-1}\\) for \\( k \\) from 1 to 12.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using the sympy library to compute the binomial coefficients and sum them up.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the range of k\nk_values = range(1, 13)\n\n# Calculate the sum of binomial coefficients\ntotal_subsets = sum(sp.binomial(12 - k, k - 1) for k in k_values)\n\nprint(total_subsets)\n```\n```output\n144\n```\nThe number of nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 12\\}\\) that have the property that the number of elements in \\( B \\) is equal to the least element of \\( B \\) is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).", "probs": []}
